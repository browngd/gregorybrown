                  <p>BitCrunched! realizes with the declining costs of computers, it is not always economical to repair a computer.  With this in mind BitCrunched! has developed a strategy to help you determine the best course of action when this issue arises.  We will troubleshoot the problem and determine the costs associated with a repair and help you compare those to the costs of replacement.  If you choose to go the replacement route, we only charge the fee for the service call.</p>

                  <p>Power Supply problems can occur after a power surge or other power related issues.  Because of the varying nature of power supplies across the different computer manufactuers, power supplies must be ordered and can be recived within a day or two to complete the repair.</p>

                  <a name="system-board-replacement"><h2>System Board Replacement</h2></a>
                  <p>System board replacement is not usually economical unless the computer is a higher end model.  Often times, the cost of a system board plus repair costs can exceed the cost to replace a system.  If needed, BitCrunched! can replace system boards however a cost analysis should always be considered before repair.</p>

                  <p>If you have had a total hard drive failure or your operating system has been corrupted BitCrunched! can re-install the operating system on your computer.  Due to licensing issues, you must have your recovery or re-installation disks that came with your computer.  Without these disks, we will need to work with you to purchase a licensed copy of your operating system.</p>
